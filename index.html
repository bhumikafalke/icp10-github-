  <h1>Hello Everyone</h1>
   <p>Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, 
    the Sultanate of Golconda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers.
     Shivaji offered passage and his service to Aurangzeb to invade the declining Sultanate of Bijapur.
      After Aurangzeb's departure for the north due to a war of succession, Shivaji conquered territories ceded by Bijapur in the name of the Mughals.[9] 
      : 63  Following the Battle of Purandar, Shivaji entered into vassalage with the Mughal empire, assuming the role of a Mughal chief and undertaking military expeditions on behalf of the empire for a brief duration.[10] Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts,
       and forming a Maratha navy.</p>
